# Stock Sentiment Analysis Project


Searched real-time news headlines on Google News using the keyword "OOO stock" and extracted article summaries.

Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (TextBlob & Vader) to assign sentiment scores (positive/neutral/negative) to each article.

Stored all processed data in PostgreSQL for structured querying and analysis.

Compared the sentiment scores over time against real-time stock prices to examine potential correlation patterns.

Visualized sentiment trends and price fluctuations using Python (Matplotlib, Pandas).

Project goal: to explore the relationship between media sentiment and short-term price movement.
